this is a general code converter framework. that takes as input a hyper text file and generates an html file. We have also generated latex using this framework to show that this framework can be used to convert to lot of other types of languages.

HOW TO RUN:
extract this  folder and go to the source sub folder, there we find "source html" folder. Which 
when entered has a main script file called hcc.
Suppose the input htxt file is input.htxt and we want to generate output.html 
we run it using the following command

./hcc input output

for the latex counter part it is 
./lcc input output

Technologies Used:
Awk
Flex
